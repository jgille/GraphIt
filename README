1. Description
===============================================================================================

GraphIt is an easy to use, fast, RAM only (or mostly) property graph
database. It implements the Blueprints interfaces
(https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/), thereby supporting
advanced ad-hoc traversals using Gremlin
(https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki).

By default all data is stored in memory, optionally dumped to
disk/restored from disk on graph shutdown and init. However, the
repositories used by the graph are pluggable so you are free to write
your own repos. For instance you might want to keep all graph
primitives, i.e. node ids and relations, in RAM only but store
properties in a key/value store. This can be accomplished by using custom
PropertiesRepository instances for the graph.

2. Installation
===============================================================================================

Build from the root directory using:

mvn install -DskiptTests

3. Usage
===============================================================================================

Please see the wiki page for examples: https://github.com/jon-ivmark/GraphIt/wiki/Basic-Examples

4. Dependencies
===============================================================================================

All required third party libraries are included in the project jar file.
To make use of all features you will need google guava libraries though:
